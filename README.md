Trivia game using JavaScript, jQuery, timers, and intervals

<h1>Instructions</h1>
</p>This is a trivia game about cartoons - both new and old.  See if you can guess the right answers before the time runs out.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This game showcases the use of JavaScript, jQuery, Timers, and Intervals. The JavaScript is built using multiple functions that cascade.  The JavaScript randomly picks a question and verifies the question has not been asked before while answers are randomly assigned to buttons using a function that shuffles an array.</p>
